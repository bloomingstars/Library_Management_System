The deployed application consists of the following features:

Sign up

Sign in

View all books 

View all libraries

Edit user profile


Our application consists of a single admin (currently) for which the details would be stored in the database initially. The users can sign up either as a librarian or a student and the attributes would be stored in the db. The guest user would be able to access the home page and be able to only view the list of available books and libraries. Once signed up, the new users would automatically be signed into the application dashboard and would be able to see additional tabs like editing his/her profiles.


Depending on the type of user, only particular fields would be displayed depending on whether it is a student or a librarian while signing up. For eg, a librarian would be able to fill in library details while a student would be asked for something like ‘level of education’
